# Deploying Machine Learning Models : Lead Conversion


## What is ML Ops ? 

Machine Learning has the potential to help solve business problems and deliver real business value. However, implementing Ml at scale can be challenging in enterpise environments. Just like how software developers have DevOps to bring together Software Engineers and Operations, Data Scientists can leverage ML Ops the same way.

Many companies still have Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists develop models in silos. The complexity of the devlopment environment makes it hard to collaborate. This leads to loss of productivity and delay in adding value to the business. 

Ml Ops is about creating an end to end solution from research to deployment of the ML model into production. This brings in the agility that DevOps brings ro software development. Data Scientists can operate in a shared and collaborative work space and initiate development training and prediction using standardised procedures. This improved time to value.
